Genome Assembly /Neta Sohlberg

In genome assembly many short sequences (reads) from a sequencing machine is assembled into long sequences â€“ultimately chromosomes.
 This is done by ordering overlapping reads so they together represent genomic sequence.
 For example given these three reads:
 AGGTCGTAG, CGTAGAGCTGGGAG, GGGAGGTTGAAA
 ordering them based on their overlap like this:
  AGGTCGTAG
      CGTAGAGCTGGGAG
               GGGAGGTTGAAA
produces the genomic sequence:
    AGGTCGTAGAGCTGGGAGGTTGAAA
